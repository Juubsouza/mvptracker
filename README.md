# MVP Tracker

This is a simple application built with the purpose of learning a bit more about React Native, and related concepts such as Redux and Push notifications.
The core purpose of the app is to be a sort of companion app for the game Ragnarok Online, keeping track of a list of "MVP" (monsters) and receiving push notifications when they are about to respawn.

## API
### Ragnarok Online API

This project makes use of the Ragnarok API available in the link https://ragnapi.com/

## Technologies Used
### React Native

React Native is a popular framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to build native mobile apps using JavaScript and React, a library for building user interfaces. 

### Expo

Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React. It includes a universal runtime and libraries that let you build native apps, from a single codebase, using JavaScript and React.

### Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.

### Push Notifications

Push notifications are used in this project to alert the user about certain events. They are implemented using the `expo-notifications` library, which provides a unified API for both local and remote notifications.
